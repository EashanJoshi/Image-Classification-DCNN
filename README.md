# Image-Classification-DCNN
Multiclass Image Classification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network

This project offers an in-depth exploration of image recognition using TensorFlow and the Tiny ImageNet dataset. It includes a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that takes users through the entire process, from setting up a TensorFlow environment optimized for GPU usage to downloading and preprocessing the dataset. Key features of this project include detailed steps for building and training an image recognition model, techniques for data visualization, and performance evaluation. We also conduct an analysis of model accuracy across different image categories, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of our approach. This repository is not just a tool for image recognition but also a learning platform for those interested in deep learning and computer vision. It stands as a valuable resource for both hobbyists and professionals looking to delve into the nuances of TensorFlow-based image recognition.
